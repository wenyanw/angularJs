Using Dependency InjectionDI is pervasive throughout Angular. You can use it when defining components or when providing run and config blocks for a module.Components such as services, directives, filters, and animations are defined by an injectable factory method or constructor function. These components can be injected with "service" and "value" components as dependencies.Controllers are defined by a constructor function, which can be injected with any of the "service" and "value" components as dependencies, but they can also be provided with special dependencies. See Controllers below for a list of these special dependencies.The run method accepts a function, which can be injected with "service", "value" and "constant" components as dependencies. Note that you cannot inject "providers" into run blocks.The config method accepts a function, which can be injected with "provider" and "constant" components as dependencies. Note that you cannot inject "service" or "value" components into configuration.
